#Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR4 - Lensing Mask

Lensing masks are provided in two regions of the sky:
Deep56 (D56) and BOSS North (BN).

Contents:

* act_dr4.01_s14s15_[D56/BN]_lensing_mask.fits, patch = D56 for deep56, BN for BOSS North;

The lensing maps have been divided by the mean of the square of the mask $w_2 = mean(mask**2)$.
This number has to be multiplied back out if you want to use the local value of the lensing
convergence in your analysis (e.g. when stacking). If you are doing a harmonic space analysis (e.g. a cross-spectrum),
then the appropriate mask correction has to be applied. These corrections are described in the
associated Jupyter notebook tutorials.
