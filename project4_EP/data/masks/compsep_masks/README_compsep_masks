TILe-C: Masks for Component Separated Maps 
==========================================

Version tag: v1.2.0

We release apodized masks for each region (D56 and BN). Each mask has values ranging from 0 to 1. It has already been applied
to the map. If you are doing a real-space analysis, you should exclude any pixels where the value in the mask is appreciably different from 1 since
the signal there should be attenuated by the value in the mask.

If you are doing a harmonic-space analysis, you should apply an overall correction to your
power spectrum of the form 1/mean(mask1 * mask2) (or equivalent for spherical harmonics).
(Note: Mode-coupling is probably unimportant for the Compton-Y map since the spectrum is not
very red. Mode-coupling can be important for the CMB map, but it's unlikely that you will
need to directly cross-correlate the CMB map in harmonic space. If you do, then
keep in mind that during reconstruction of these maps, the mask was applied prior to a series of
Fourier operations, and many power spectrum codes assume the mask has not yet been applied.)

This mask does NOT mask any Galactic contamination, neither does it mask any inpainted
sources. The latter are very few in number, so they should not be a concern. Galactic
contamination likely does not affect any cross-correlation.
