## ACT DR4.01 Source masks

Binary maps that can be multiplied pixel-wise with the data maps to mask the contribution from bright point-like sources as well as extended sources.

The product is described in Aiola et al 2020 and used for the power spectrum analysis in Choi et al 2020.

##Input source catalogs:

#Point-like sources:
The input source catalog includes sources detected in the ACT DR4 s13-s16 f150 maps with a SNR>=5.
The minimum flux at which the catalog is complete varies across the sky due to inhomogeneous map-noise, for this reason we defined two flux cuts:
* "deep": sources detected at SNR>=5 and flux >= 15mJy over the D1, D56, and D8 regions
* "wide": sources detected at SNR>=5 and flux >= 100mJy over the whole AA region 

#Extended sources:
From the HyperLeda catalog (Markov et al. 2014), we select objects with surface brightness <25 mag in the optical B-band and with a liner extent of 
d>4arcmin. We mask d/2+2arcmin around such sources in both the "deep" and "wide".

See Sec. 5.3 in Aiola et al 2020 for more information.

##Products and file names 
FITS files are named: act_dr4.01_mask_s13s16_{flux}mJy_{diam}arcmin.fits  

* "flux": flux cut [possible tags: 0.015, 0.100]
* "diam": diameter of the mask centered on each source [possible tags: 5,8,10,35]
  
##Remarks
All FITS files have a common WCS geometry and cover the full AA region. The 15mJy (deep) masks can only be used on the D1, D56, and D8 regions.
The portion of the AA region that does not overlap with the regions mentioned is simply unity.
