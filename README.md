The following contains my work from my time with the USC Theoretical Cosmology Group.
<br><br>
Project 1:<br>
Work conducted regarding the validation and extension of the PSZ2 Galaxy Cluster Catalog. Done at the beginning of my sophomore year. Corresponds to the following publication: https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06364
<br><br>
Project 2:<br>
Work done to enhance computational efficiency in the Lorentz boosting code, CosmoBoost (https://github.com/syasini/CosmoBoost). This involved exploring numerical instabilities to determine why the code was breaking, implementing a new analytic approach to avoid the computational costs of numerically solving the kernel, and implementing a new chunking approach which allowed for large kernels to be passed into the ODE solver without requiring excessive amounts of RAM.

Project 3:<br>
In progress: Fisher matrix construction, likelihood analysis
